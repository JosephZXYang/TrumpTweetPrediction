1,Iowa was amazing last night. The event could not have worked out better. We raised $6000000 for our great vets. They were so happy &amp; proud
1,Getting ready to take off for Nashua New Hampshire. Big crowd will be there soon. Fun!
1,The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?
1,The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
1,.@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
1,Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse who is easy to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
1,.@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6000000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
1,.@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6000000 for our VETS!
1,@classyexplorer: @oreillyfactor @DRUDGE So Bill if America was SO LONGING to learn more about candidates why the 50 percent audience loss?
1,"@gigglemitz: @GeraldoRivera  @FoxNews damn fox is really acting like a baby today. I guess Trump got under their skin - pretty biased!Twitter for Android,Hillary Clinton is a major national security risk. Not presidential material!Twitter for Android,I will be in Iowa all day and until Tuesday morning. Finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!Twitter for Android,The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation."" They are now under investigation. Bad!"
1,.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
1,.@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
1,.@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends
1,I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
1,Ted Cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
1,Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans scam!
1,Wow just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me will repeal &amp; replace. He lies!
1,"By not doing the failed poorly rated debate I was able to make the point of not allowing ""unfairness"" - while raising $6000000 for VETS."
1,If I would have done the last debate a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also VETS got $6000000.
1,I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY!
1,I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy!
1,It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1,My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice
1,Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
1,The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
1,I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
1,I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign the only one. I will keep doing but not worth it!
1,Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN
1,Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!
1,During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
1,Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
1,The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
1,"And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie!"
1,Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
1,I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews
1,Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat!

1,Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use
1,@tzard000: @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Everyone continues to pile onto Donald but they can NEVER take away our votes!  Thank you!
1,@TakingIt_Back:  @nytimes keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016 Thanks.
1,Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!
1,Wow I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!
1,Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!
1,The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting and plenty of it - but we will prevail!
1,The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
1,Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie run.
1,That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
1,"A political commentator for @cnn which I no longer watch said ""Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries."" I set all-time record!"
1,In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue. This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!
1,I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!
1,What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back. I said no.
1,@AprilLaJune: OREGON votes today! Go vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME! https://t.co/SLYwyM8w1D
1,Wow 30000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?
1,"The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. ""You can tell them to go BLANK themselves"" - was about China NOT WOMEN!"
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
1,Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
1,Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
1,Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
1,"Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so he should runnot her.Will he bring the ""energizer"" to D.C.?"
1,How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA the worst economic deal in U.S. history?
1,Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky she should drop out of race. System rigged!
1,Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women and they knew it. Apologize?

1,Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!

1,Congratulations to my son Eric on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry and its great Ailsa Course. Always support kids!
1,Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back just like we will take America back. No games!
1,Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland. What a great day especially when added to the brave &amp; brilliant vote.
1,Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
1,The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!
1,Many people are equating BREXIT and what is going on in Great Britain with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!
1,"@DarrenWaggener: @realDonaldTrump What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November..vote TRUMP 2016Twitter for Android,@Jolena3: @realDonaldTrump And we will get it back once we have President Trump! Can't wait!"""
1,So funny Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk no action!
1,Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son Eric did a great job - under budget!
1,George Will one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago) has left the Republican Party.He's made many bad calls
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama) is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call.
1,Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
1,Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot but I never did = lie! Was there to support son
1,The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
1,People in our country want borders and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!
1,Hillary Clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune I am spending very little. Close in polls!
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
1,"The ""dirty"" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good."

1,The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China and many others are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

1,"Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware ""the event had to be held in Cleveland"" - a total lie. These people are sick!"
1,The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release
1,It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
1,It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said the system is totally rigged!
1,Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against me.The good news-the people get it!
1,Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!

1,"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away no pictures."""
1,I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
1,In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
1,The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!

1,Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed great people!

1,Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
1,"On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. ""Special: Meet the Trumps"" Hope you enjoy!"
1,Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
1,It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
1,Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
1,"I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8 she's out!"
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
1,"Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information."" Not fit!"

1,Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch her time will come!
1,I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies.
1,Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center Airport - and destroyed City
1,Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
1,Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
1,I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics

1,After today Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary.
1,Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
1,Way to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!
1,Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
1,President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
1,The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
1,I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily few people are watching - dead network!
1,Crime is out of control and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!
1,Bernie Sanders who has lost most of his leverage has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

1,Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!

1,Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes Crooked Hillary Clinton can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!

1,Goofy Elizabeth Warren who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over
1,We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
1,As the days and weeks go by  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
1,It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
1,I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
1,If Goofy Elizabeth Warren a very weak Senator didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
1,.@FoxNews is much better and far more truthful than @CNN which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.
1,The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
1,We are TRYING to fight ISIS and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching
1,I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!

1,Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough!
1,President Obama just had a news conference but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse!
1,.@CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!
1,Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!
1,@RoxaneTancredi:  Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people.
1,The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!
1,Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!
1,Congratulations to my children Don and Tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!
1,Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
1,In November I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
1,John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
1,Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support. Great speech!
1,Wow Ted Cruz got booed off the stage didn't honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!
1,.@mike_pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.
1,Arena was packed totally electric!
1,I am soooo proud of my children Don Eric and Tiffany - their speeches under enormous pressure were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!
1,Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!
1,Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!
1,What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
1,Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
1,One of the best produced including the incredible stage &amp; set in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove
1,Another attack this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
1,Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
1,I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
1,@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain
1,The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
1,Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
1,Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also Crooked Hillary hates her!
1,Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes really vicious. RIGGED
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
1,Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
1,Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
1,I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
1,Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
1,Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
1,@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals https://t.co/0FFeKTsuJn #HillaryKaine2016
1,@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America. see it
1,The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
1,Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for V.P. is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
1,Wow President Obama's brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
1,Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
1,An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
1,"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!"
1,Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
1,I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!
1,The @CNN panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
1,If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
1,Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
1,The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
1,The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!
1,The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!
1,Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
1,The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me
1,How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!
1,Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
1,If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same.
1,"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie."
1,Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!
1,Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
1,The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
1,Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
1,Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
1,I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
1,Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!
1,Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
1,Funny if you listen to @FoxNews the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference
1,Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
1,Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
1,In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
1,For the record I have ZERO investments in Russia.
1,You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
1,No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
1,I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
1,Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
1,As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
1,"Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!"
1,The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
1,Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
1,"Our not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz!"
1,Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
1,@DavidWohl: Barack is offended that @realDonaldTrump will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly

1,@LallyRay: Poll: Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks - Breitbart https://t.co/bVAj52fA3Y @realdonaldtrump  Great!
1,The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
1,"Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream!"
1,Two policemen just shot in San Diego one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!
1,"@AnnCoulter: I believe in science"" Dem code for ""we're shutting down coal mines steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing"""""
1,Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
1,General John Allen who I never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary
1,Little Michael Bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
1,If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary
1,"Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" ReallyI just beat 16 people and am beating her!"
1,The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal!
1,Wow my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out V.P. pick!
1,I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff our country needs change!
1,@patrioticpepe: @realDonaldTrump ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!! #Trump2016 https://t.co/yB72Bm2muM
1,Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
1,"Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings"
1,I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better!
1,Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
1,Crooked's stop in Johnstown Pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200 - with Bill VP
1,"The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!"
1,Wow NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
1,Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews
1,Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
1,Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
1,"Captain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!"
1,I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me!
1,The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
1,@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope.
1,Wow it is unbelievable how distorted one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!

1,Finally in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!

1,Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!
1,Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!
1,I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice
1,Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
1,The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?

1,The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated &amp; demoralized Dems
1,The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
1,Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
1,"Hillary's debate answer on delay: ""That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We've had free --"
1,and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a -
1,during a general election. I for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind --
1,"of position."" Then separately she stated ""He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of --"
1,"this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy."" She then said ""We have to accept the results and look to the future Donald --"
1,"Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead."" So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad"
1,In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
1,It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
1,states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
1,Serious voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!

1,fires its employees builds a new factory or plant in the other country and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S.  ......
1,without retribution or consequence is WRONG! There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ......
1,wanting to sell their product cars A.C. units etc. back across the border. This tax will make leaving financially difficult but.....

1,Yes it is true - Carlos Slim the great businessman from Mexico called me about getting together for a meeting. We met HE IS A GREAT GUY!
1,Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!
